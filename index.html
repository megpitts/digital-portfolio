            <p>Hello. My name is</p>
            <h1 class="name">Megan Pitts</h1>
            <p>I am a senior at Indiana University studying informatics with a medical
                sciences
                cognate and a computer science minor. I have interest in full stack development, web development, and
                information
                systems. Outside of school, I love reading and learning more about outer space.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p style="font-style: italic;">Hardworking student with a passion for learning and watching rocket
                    launches.</p>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™ve always loved the challenge that programming offers but found that I wanted to broaden my
                    horizons with a major that covers all facets of technology. In addition to my major in informatics,
                    I have chosen to continue to pursue a better understanding of programming with a
                    computer science minor. To round out my informatics degree, I chose to specialize in medical
                    sciences. While this may seem misaligned with my other interests, I found it to be the perfect
                    addition. Technology and medicine have more in common than one may realize. The same logical
                    challenges that come with programming can also be found in medicine. To tackle these challenges,
                    there must be very precise attention to detail and a willingness to always learn something new. The
                    similarities kept appearing throughout my studies, and I became hooked on the unique but often
                    similar obstacles that medical sciences threw my way.</p>

            <h2>Strenghts and Values</h2>

            <p>While most of my hard skills are highlighted below with my experience, I also posses a number of soft skills
                and values that I have prioritized throughout my time as a student.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>During high school, my time as an athlete taught me how to be a <span>leader</span> and <span>work
                        well in teams</span>. As the captain, I was responsible for leading our team to
                    success and ensuring that we all worked together to acheive our goals.</li>
                <li>In my role as a teaching assistant for the Basic Human Physiology Labs, I have learned how to <span>effectively
                        communicate</span> new ideas to fellow students.</li>
                <li>As a student with a job, <span>time management</span> and, more specifically, getting assignments
                    submitted early have become things that are constantly at the forefront of my mind, so I do not fall
                    behind on work.</li>
                <li>Being involved with computer science for the last six years has taught me to be <span>attentive to
                        the small details</span> in all my work. This experience has also developed my
                    <span>problem-solving</span> skills as well as my <span>ability to teach myself new topics</span>
                    when necessary.
